## Patrons

The `rust-nostr` project relies greatly on the generous support of the organizations, companies, and individuals who have become a Patron. 
Each year, we seek new sources of significant funding to support our ongoing efforts. 
Please [contact us](maintainers.md) if you or your organization is interested in becoming a Patron.
